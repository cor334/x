Ok its connected to github and i can push  to github but whats it for

Great question! Now that you've connected Overleaf to GitHub, here's what this actually does for you:
Main Benefits

Version Control & History

    GitHub keeps a complete history of every change you make
    You can go back to any previous version of your document
    See exactly what changed between versions (useful for tracking edits in papers/thesis)
    Add commit messages to remember why you made specific changes

Collaboration

    Multiple people can work on the same document
    GitHub tracks who made which changes
    Collaborators can work offline on their own computers using Git
    You can review changes before merging them (pull requests)

Backup & Access

    Your work is backed up on GitHub's servers
    Access your LaTeX files from anywhere, not just Overleaf
    If Overleaf is down, you still have your files
    Work offline on your computer, then sync later

Advanced Workflows

    Use your favorite local LaTeX editor (VS Code, TeXmaker, etc.) when preferred
    Automate tasks with GitHub Actions (like auto-compiling PDFs)
    Include your LaTeX project in larger codebases
    Share your work publicly or keep it private

Common Use Cases

    Thesis/Dissertation: Track progress over months/years, never lose work
    Academic Papers: Collaborate with co-authors, track revisions for journals
    Course Materials: Reuse and update materials each semester
    Team Projects: Multiple people editing without overwriting each other's work

Simple Workflow Example

Overleaf (write) → Push to GitHub (backup/share) → 
Pull to local computer (work offline) → Push back → 
Pull in Overleaf (continue online)

The GitHub connection essentially turns your Overleaf project into a professional document with full tracking and collaboration features - think "Google Docs version history on steroids" but for LaTeX!

I want you to Analise 10 chapters of St Francis of Assisi and conceptualize the story create a prompt for each chapter applying a similar style to the set of images using  midjourny

I'd be happy to analyze 10 chapters about St. Francis of Assisi and create Midjourney prompts for each! However, I need you to provide the text or summaries of the chapters first.
What I Need From You

Please share either:

    The actual chapter text (paste it in)
    Chapter summaries (main events and themes)
    Or tell me which biography/book you're using so I can work with well-known episodes

In the Meantime - Here's What I'll Create

For each chapter, I'll provide:

    Primary prompt: Main scene or moment
    Style consistency tags: To maintain visual cohesion across all 10 images
    Aspect ratio and parameters: Optimized for book illustrations

Style Direction Needed

What artistic style do you envision? For St. Francis, common approaches include:

Traditional Religious Art

"medieval illuminated manuscript style, gold leaf details, Byzantine icons"

Renaissance Style

"in the style of Giotto, Fra Angelico, Italian Renaissance fresco"

Modern Spiritual

"contemporary spiritual art, soft watercolors, ethereal light, minimalist"

Storybook Illustration

"children's book illustration, warm colors, gentle lines, whimsical details"

Once you share the chapters, I'll create consistent prompts that tell the visual story of St. Francis's journey. Each prompt will maintain the same artistic style while capturing the unique essence of each chapter.

Please paste in your chapter text or summaries, and let me know your preferred artistic style!

I'll analyze these 10 chapters from G.K. Chesterton's biography of St. Francis of Assisi and create Midjourney prompts for each chapter. Based on the spiritual and medieval nature of the text, I'll use a consistent artistic style reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts with Renaissance influences.
Chapter-by-Chapter Analysis and Midjourney Prompts
Chapter 1: The Problem of St. Francis

Conceptualization: This chapter introduces Francis as a paradoxical figure - both worldly troubadour and mystic saint, bridging the gap between secular and sacred understanding.

Chapter 10: The Testament of St. Francis

Conceptualization: The legacy and influence of Francis, showing how his spirit transformed art, culture, and Christianity itself.

Midjourney Prompt:

Vast tree growing from Francis's tomb, branches bearing symbols of Franciscan influence - Giotto painting, Dante writing, churches, poor being fed, nature flourishing, medieval allegorical style, rich symbolic details, golden fruits of spiritual legacy --ar 3:2 --v 6

Consistent Style Elements for All Images:

    Medieval illuminated manuscript aesthetic
    Gold leaf accents and ornate borders
    Influence of Giotto and Fra Angelico
    Warm earth tones with spiritual light
    Symbolic rather than purely realistic representation
    Sacred geometry and compositional balance

These prompts maintain visual coherence while capturing each chapter's unique spiritual and narrative essence, creating a series that could illustrate a medieval-style book about St. Francis.

We are using V7

I'll update the prompts for Midjourney V7, which has different parameters and capabilities than V6. V7 tends to handle natural language better and produces more photorealistic results by default, so I'll adjust the style directions accordingly.
Updated Midjourney V7 Prompts for St. Francis Chapters
Chapter 1: The Problem of St. Francis

Young Francis transitioning from troubadour to saint, split medieval illuminated manuscript composition, left side worldly with lute and fine clothes, right side spiritual with simple robe and halo, intricate gold leaf borders, deep blue and crimson pigments, Byzantine icon style painting --ar 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 2: The World St. Francis Found

Medieval city of Assisi emerging from darkness at dawn, Francis as small silhouette on hillside with raised arms greeting the sun, birds taking flight, painted in the style of a Giotto fresco with tempera colors, spiritual awakening, earthy ochres and emerging golden light --ar 16:9 --v 7

Chapter 3: Francis the Fighter

Francis of Assisi embracing a leper on a dusty Italian road, moment of spiritual transformation, painted in Fra Angelico style, soft divine light surrounding both figures, medieval Umbrian landscape, warm golden hour lighting with religious iconography --ar 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 4: Francis the Builder

Francis rebuilding San Damiano church stone by stone, speaking crucifix glowing above, beams of light through broken roof, medieval Italian fresco style, architectural details in browns and grays with divine golden light, spiritual construction --ar 16:9 --v 7

Chapter 5: Le Jongleur de Dieu

Francis as God's joyful fool dancing in patched robes, surrounded by music notes and birds, inverted perspective showing earth above and heaven below, bright medieval miniature painting style, celebrating holy poverty with whimsical energy --ar 1:1 --v 7

Chapter 6: The Little Poor Man

Francis in brown habit addressing Brother Sun with a face, Sister Moon, personified elements of creation as family, medieval allegorical painting style, Canticle of the Creatures visualization, warm earth tones with gold and silver celestial elements --ar 16:9 --v 7

Chapter 7: The Three Orders

Francis and Clare praying at Portiuncula, surrounded by expanding circles of followers in brown habits, medieval manuscript illumination showing three orders, divine light emanating from the saints, hierarchical composition with gold details --ar 16:9 --v 7

Chapter 8: The Mirror of Christ

Francis receiving stigmata on Mount Alverno, six-winged seraph crucified in the sky, supernatural rays creating wounds, medieval apocalyptic art style, deep purple sky with blazing gold divine light, mystical vision painting --ar 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 9: Miracles and Death

Death of St Francis at Portiuncula, circle of brown-robed friars, his soul as ascending dove, angels with golden ladder, painted in Giotto's style, soft candlelight mixing with heavenly radiance, peaceful and sublime --ar 16:9 --v 7

Chapter 10: The Testament of St. Francis

Great tree growing from Francis's tomb, branches bearing symbols of his legacy - art, charity, nature, learning, medieval allegorical tree of life style, rich symbolic details in gold and colors, spiritual fruits and influences spreading outward --ar 3:2 --v 7

Key adjustments for V7:

    Removed "--v 6" and replaced with "--v 7"
    Made descriptions more naturalistic while maintaining the medieval artistic style references
    Specified painting styles more clearly (fresco, tempera, illuminated manuscript)
    Reduced some of the more abstract descriptors that V6 handled better
    Maintained consistent medieval religious art aesthetic throughout

These prompts should work well with V7's improved understanding of artistic styles and natural language processing.

Overall they are very good but there are some corrections needed. Also needed is to help the reader to make sense of the image. The image needs to fit 9x6 page that is pre chapter. So some will be  landscape

I'll revise the prompts to better fit a 9x6 page format and help readers connect the visual imagery to each chapter's narrative. I'll make them clearer and more directly tied to the key moments Chesterton describes.

Reader Context: Francis's unique relationship with all creation
Chapter 7: The Three Orders (Landscape)

Three concentric circles of people around Portiuncula chapel: friars in brown, Poor Clares in grey, lay people in everyday dress, Francis and Clare at center in prayer, golden light emanating outward, medieval hierarchical composition --ar 3:2 --v 7

Reader Context: The three orders Francis founded spreading his mission
Chapter 8: The Mirror of Christ (Portrait)

Reader Context: Francis's peaceful mission to convert rather than conquer
Chapter 9: Miracles and Death (Landscape)

Francis lying on ground at Portiuncula, brothers kneeling around him, soft light from candles and divine glow from above, birds gathering at windows, Giotto death scene style, peaceful browns and soft golds --ar 3:2 --v 7

Reader Context: Francis's death returning to earth in humility
Chapter 10: The Testament of St. Francis (Portrait)

Reader Context: Francis's lasting influence on civilization
Format Notes:

    Landscape (3:2 ratio) for chapters needing broader scene context
    Portrait (2:3 ratio) for more focused, symbolic moments
    Each maintains medieval artistic style while being clear for modern readers
    Simplified compositions to work at book page size
    Direct visual references to key chapter events

These should work better as pre-chapter illustrations that help orient readers to each chapter's main theme while maintaining artistic cohesion.

Midjurney dosee not understand  Francis receiving stigmata on Mount Alverno, six-winged seraph crucified in the sky, supernatural rays creating wounds, medieval apocalyptic art style, deep purple sky with blazing gold divine light, mystical vision painting

You're right - that prompt for Chapter 8 is too complex and uses terminology that Midjourney might not interpret correctly. Let me revise it to be clearer and more likely to produce the intended result:
Revised Chapter 8: The Mirror of Christ (Landscape)

St Francis kneeling on rocky mountain peak, large winged angel with six wings appearing in golden clouds above, beams of golden light connecting angel to Francis's hands and feet, medieval religious painting style, purple and gold sky --ar 3:2 --v 7

Reader Context: The miraculous vision at Mount Alverno where Francis received the stigmata
Alternative simpler version if that's still too complex:

St Francis praying on mountain top, glowing angel with multiple wings in the sky above him, golden light rays between them, medieval Italian religious art style, dramatic purple sunset sky with gold clouds --ar 3:2 --v 7

The key changes:

    Removed "stigmata" and "seraph" as specific terms Midjourney might not recognize
    Simplified "crucified" concept which might confuse the AI
    Used more direct visual descriptions
    Kept the essential elements: Francis, mountain, winged figure, divine light connection

This should produce a clearer image that still captures the mystical moment described in Chapter 8, where Francis has his vision and receives the wounds of Christ.

All going well but one problem did St Francis wear a beard and how can we make him look similar

You're absolutely right to ask about consistency in Francis's appearance across the images. According to historical accounts and traditional depictions:

St. Francis's Appearance:

    Yes, he had a beard - typically depicted as thin and pointed
    Dark hair and beard (described as brownish/black)
    Slight build, medium height
    Brown eyes
    Southern Italian/Mediterranean complexion
    Always in simple brown habit tied with rope cord

To maintain visual consistency across all 10 illustrations, I should add a character description to each prompt. Here's a standardized description to add to each:
Standard Francis Description to Add to Each Prompt:

"St Francis with thin pointed dark beard, brown eyes, slight build, wearing simple brown habit with rope belt"

For example, Chapter 1 would become:

Split scene medieval painting: left side shows young Francis with thin pointed dark beard as wealthy troubadour in fine robes playing lute at feast, right side shows older Francis with same thin pointed beard in rough brown habit with birds, divided by ornate gold border, illuminated manuscript style --ar 3:2 --v 7

Additional Consistency Tips:

    Always mention "brown habit with rope belt" when he's shown as a friar
    Include "thin pointed dark beard" in every prompt
    Keep face shape consistent by adding "gaunt face" in later chapters (after his fasting)
    Young vs. Old: In early chapters specify "young Francis" vs. later "aged Francis"

Would you like me to revise all 10 prompts with these consistent physical descriptions included? This will help Midjourney maintain visual continuity throughout the chapter illustrations.

Chapter 1 is a very good image style but it is difacult as to what it is saying

You're right - Chapter 1's image needs to be clearer in its visual storytelling. The split composition could be confusing without better visual cues. Let me revise it to make the transformation more obvious:
Revised Chapter 1: The Problem of St. Francis (Landscape)

Medieval triptych painting: left panel shows young Francis with thin pointed beard in rich merchant clothes counting money with his father, center panel shows same Francis throwing away fine clothes before a bishop, right panel shows Francis with thin pointed beard in brown habit with rope belt preaching to birds, gold dividers between panels, illuminated manuscript style --ar 3:2 --v 7

Reader Context: Francis's journey from wealthy merchant's son to humble saint
Alternative clearer version:

Before and after scene divided by gothic arch: left side young Francis with thin pointed beard at feast table in silk robes holding wine cup, right side same Francis with thin pointed beard in patched brown habit sharing bread with lepers, medieval illuminated style with gold details --ar 3:2 --v 7

The key improvements:

    More specific actions that show the contrast (money/feast vs. poverty/service)
    Clear "before and after" or progression structure
    Maintaining the same face/beard to show it's the same person
    Activities that directly relate to Chapter 1's theme of Francis being both worldly and spiritual

This should make it immediately clear to readers that they're seeing Francis's transformation from his wealthy secular life to his religious calling, which is the central "problem" or paradox that Chesterton discusses in Chapter 1.

also the leaper later on dose not realy look like a leaper

You're right - depicting leprosy accurately while remaining appropriate for a book illustration is challenging. Medieval art had specific visual conventions for showing lepers that modern AI might not recognize. Let me revise that prompt:
Revised Chapter 3: Francis the Fighter (Portrait)

Instead of the leper scene, let's use the more pivotal moment from this chapter:

Young Francis with thin pointed dark beard falling from his horse on road to war, vision of glowing cross in clouds above, his armor and weapons scattered, medieval manuscript style, moment of spiritual revelation, golden light from heaven --ar 2:3 --v 7

Reader Context: Francis's vision that ended his military ambitions
Or if we want to keep the compassion theme without depicting disease:

Francis with thin pointed dark beard giving his rich cloak to a ragged beggar in the snow, medieval Italian town in background, both figures illuminated by soft golden light, style of Giotto fresco, act of charity --ar 2:3 --v 7

Reader Context: Francis's transformation from soldier to saint through acts of mercy

The leper encounter was important symbolically in the chapter (representing Francis facing his fears), but visually it's difficult to depict appropriately. The falling from horse/vision or the cloak-giving scenes are clearer and equally represent the chapter's theme of Francis abandoning worldly glory for spiritual calling.

Which approach would you prefer for Chapter 3?

^x9 potrate what raico should image be 1x1

For a 9x6 page (which I assume means 9 inches wide by 6 inches tall), the aspect ratio would be 3:2, which is what we've been using for landscape orientation.

For portrait orientation on a 9x6 page (if you mean 6 inches wide by 9 inches tall), the ratio would be 2:3.

For Midjourney:

    Landscape format (9 wide x 6 tall): use --ar 3:2
    Portrait format (6 wide x 9 tall): use --ar 2:3
    Square format: use --ar 1:1

Square (1:1) images would work but wouldn't fill the full page efficiently - you'd have empty space either on the sides (if fitting to height) or top/bottom (if fitting to width).

For a book with 9x6 pages, I'd recommend sticking with:

    Landscape --ar 3:2 for scenes needing broader context (battles, crowds, landscapes)
    Portrait --ar 2:3 for focused character moments or vertical compositions (Francis praying, standing figures)

This gives you variety while maximizing use of the page space. Would you like me to review which chapters should be landscape vs portrait for the best visual impact?

This is a beautiful and dramatic image! However, it looks more like a fantasy or Renaissance-style painting rather than the medieval illuminated manuscript style we've been discussing for the St. Francis book.

The image shows:

    Very realistic, three-dimensional rendering (rather than the flat, stylized medieval art)
    Dramatic atmospheric lighting and clouds (medieval art was more symbolic)
    A warrior/knight figure that doesn't match St. Francis's appearance
    Modern digital art techniques

For the St. Francis book illustrations, we should aim for:

    Medieval manuscript style - flatter, more decorative
    Consistent character - Francis with thin pointed beard, brown habit (after conversion)
    Gold leaf effects and decorated borders
    Style similar to Giotto frescoes or illuminated manuscripts
    More symbolic than realistic

Would you like me to adjust the prompts to be even more specific about achieving that medieval artistic style? We want images that look like they could have been painted in the 13th-14th century, matching the time period of St. Francis himself.

For example, adding terms like:

    "flat medieval perspective"
    "tempera paint on wood panel"
    "Byzantine influenced"
    "decorative gold background"
    "no atmospheric perspective"

This will help avoid getting modern fantasy-style artwork and keep the illustrations historically appropriate for Chesterton's biography.

do One thing i am concerned about I am generating so many images that i will not be able to identafi as to what chapter they belong to

You're absolutely right to be concerned about organization. Here's a practical solution for keeping track of your chapter images:
File Naming System for Chapter Images

When you generate and save each image, use this naming convention:

SF_Ch01_Problem_v1.jpg
SF_Ch02_World_v1.jpg
SF_Ch03_Fighter_v1.jpg

Organization Tips:

    Create a master document with:
        Chapter number
        Chapter title
        The prompt used
        Version number of attempts
        Notes about what worked/didn't work
    Make a folder structure:

   StFrancis_Illustrations/
   ├── Finals/
   ├── Drafts/
   └── Reference_Notes.txt

    Quick Reference Sheet - Keep a simple list:
        Ch1: Transformation scene (rich to poor)
        Ch2: Dawn over Assisi
        Ch3: Vision of cross/falling from horse
        Ch4: Rebuilding church
        Ch5: Joyful fool/tumbling
        Ch6: Preaching to birds
        Ch7: Three circles of followers
        Ch8: Vision on mountain
        Ch9: Death scene
        Ch10: Tree of influence

Would you like me to create a simple tracking table you can copy into a document to track your progress?

If you could put c1 on the corner of the image if midjurney would all

Unfortunately, Midjourney doesn't recognize text overlay commands like "add C1 in corner" within the image prompt itself. However, here are practical solutions:
Solutions for Labeling Chapter Images:
Option 1: Include Chapter Reference in the Prompt (Visual Cue)

Add a visual element that helps you identify chapters:

Chapter 1 prompt addition: "...illuminated manuscript with one large decorated initial letter I"
Chapter 2 prompt addition: "...with two birds in the sky"
Chapter 3 prompt addition: "...with three crosses visible"
(etc.)

Option 2: Use Midjourney's Built-in Features

    When you generate an image, immediately use the rename feature in Discord
    Right-click the image → "Edit Message" → Add "Ch1_" to the filename

Option 3: Quick Post-Processing

After downloading from Midjourney:

    Use any basic image editor (even MS Paint or Preview)
    Add a simple "C1" text in the corner
    Or use online tools like Canva (free) to batch-add chapter numbers

Option 4: Organize in Discord

Create separate Discord threads for each chapter:

#chapter-1-problem
#chapter-2-world
#chapter-3-fighter
(etc.)

The most practical approach is probably Option 2 - immediately renaming in Discord as you generate them, combined with downloading them into properly named folders on your computer.

ok

Got it! Let me know when you're ready to work on the next chapter illustration or if you need help with any of the prompts we've discussed.

To summarize where we are:

    We have 10 chapter prompts designed for medieval manuscript style
    Each includes St. Francis with consistent features (thin pointed beard, brown habit)
    Mix of landscape (--ar 3:2) and portrait (--ar 2:3) orientations
    You'll organize them by saving with clear chapter numbers

Feel free to share any test images if you want feedback on whether they're matching the medieval style and chapter themes we're aiming for.

redo the francis on the hourse

Here's a revised prompt for Chapter 3, focusing on the horse scene which is a pivotal moment in that chapter:
Revised Chapter 3: Francis the Fighter (Portrait)

Young Francis with thin pointed dark beard in armor on white horse stopped on road, glowing golden cross appearing in stormy clouds above, medieval illuminated manuscript style, flat perspective, decorated borders, his horse rearing back, tempera paint style --ar 2:3 --v 7

Reader Context: Francis's vision that called him back from his military quest
Alternative version with more medieval styling:

Medieval manuscript painting of Francis with pointed beard on horseback wearing chainmail, large golden cross vision in sky, flat Byzantine style perspective, gold leaf background, decorative border with small angels, Italian medieval art --ar 2:3 --v 7

Or for the moment of falling/dismounting:

Francis with thin pointed beard dismounting from white horse on Italian road, divine light and cross breaking through dark clouds above, medieval fresco style like Giotto, earth tones with gold heavenly light, spiritual awakening moment --ar 2:3 --v 7

The key elements maintained:

    Francis's consistent appearance (pointed beard)
    The horse and military context
    The divine vision/cross that turns him from war
    Medieval artistic style
    Clear visual storytelling of his conversion moment

This is a beautifully rendered image, but it's not quite right for illustrating Chapter 3 of the St. Francis biography. Here are the issues:

Problems with this image:

    Too ornate and heroic - Francis looks like a conquering saint/warrior rather than a young man having a spiritual crisis
    The halo - He wouldn't have a halo yet in Chapter 3 (he's not a saint yet, just beginning his conversion)
    Too stylized - This elaborate decorative style doesn't match the simpler medieval manuscript look
    Missing the story moment - Chapter 3 is about Francis failing as a soldier and having a vision that calls him back

For Chapter 3, we need to show Francis at a moment of transformation and confusion, not triumph. The chapter describes him:

    Setting out confidently for war
    Having a vision/dream that confuses him
    Returning home humiliated
    Later embracing the leper

Let me give you a simpler, more accurate prompt:

Young Francis with short dark beard falling from his horse on a dirt road, simple armor and sword dropped, vision of simple golden cross in the sky above, medieval fresco style like Giotto, muted earth colors, moment of confusion and revelation --ar 2:3 --v 7

The key is showing Francis's vulnerability and the beginning of his conversion, not his later sainthood. The style should be simpler, more like a 13th-century fresco than an elaborate illuminated manuscript.

--ar 2:3 not accepted

You're right - Midjourney V7 doesn't accept the --ar parameter in that format. For V7, you need to use:

--aspect 2:3

So the corrected prompt would be:

Young Francis with short dark beard falling from his horse on a dirt road, simple armor and sword dropped, vision of simple golden cross in the sky above, medieval fresco style like Giotto, muted earth colors, moment of confusion and revelation --aspect 2:3 --v 7

Or for the standard aspect ratios in V7:

    Portrait: --aspect 2:3
    Landscape: --aspect 3:2
    Square: --aspect 1:1

Some versions of Midjourney also accept just writing it out:

    --aspect 2:3 or --portrait
    --aspect 3:2 or --landscape
    --aspect 1:1 or --square

Try the prompt with --aspect 2:3 instead and it should work properly.

pdf

I see you've shared two images - the first is a dramatic modern/fantasy style rendering, and the second is an actual medieval fresco showing a saint on horseback with chainmail and a halo.

The second image (the fresco) is EXACTLY the style we should be aiming for! This appears to be an authentic medieval fresco, possibly 13th-14th century, showing:

    Flat perspective (no deep atmospheric effects)
    Simple, muted earth tones
    Weathered, aged appearance
    Clear symbolic elements (halo, star)
    Minimal detail but strong composition

This is perfect reference material! For Chapter 3, we want this exact style but showing young Francis (before he's a saint, so no halo yet) having his vision moment.

Here's a revised prompt based on this authentic medieval style:

Young Francis with pointed beard on horseback wearing chainmail, stopped on road looking up at golden cross in sky, flat medieval fresco style, weathered earth tones like old church wall painting, simple composition, no atmospheric perspective, aged tempera paint appearance --aspect 2:3 --v 7

The key differences from your first generated image:

    Much simpler, flatter style
    Muted, weathered colors
    No dramatic lighting effects
    More symbolic than realistic

This authentic medieval style will be much more appropriate for illustrating Chesterton's biography than the fantasy-style images.

This is much better! The style is getting closer to what we need - the weathered, fresco-like background and muted earth tones are perfect. This has the right medieval feel.

A few observations for Chapter 3:

What's working:

    The aged, weathered texture like an old church wall
    Simple, flat composition without dramatic perspective
    Muted browns and earth tones
    The cross vision in the sky

What might need adjustment:

    Francis appears a bit too old/weathered (Chapter 3 is young Francis)
    The horse and rider are still a bit too detailed/realistic for medieval style
    Consider making Francis look up at the cross more dramatically to show the moment of revelation

For the most authentic medieval look, you could try adding phrases like:

    "flat Byzantine style"
    "no depth perspective"
    "simplified forms"
    "like 13th century church fresco"

But this is definitely moving in the right direction! The weathered, muted quality perfectly captures the feel of actual medieval religious art rather than modern fantasy illustration. This style would work well for the whole book series.

Would you like to try refining this further or move on to another chapter illustration?

Try one more with 10 images

Here's a complete set of 10 chapter prompts for St. Francis, all in the medieval fresco style that's working well:
Complete Set of 10 Chapter Illustrations
Chapter 1: The Problem of St. Francis

Medieval fresco of young Francis with pointed beard on left in rich merchant robes counting coins, same Francis on right in torn brown habit giving coins to poor, weathered wall texture, flat Byzantine perspective, muted earth tones --aspect 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 2: The World St. Francis Found

Medieval fresco style dawn over Assisi hill town, small figure of Francis below with arms raised to sun, birds flying upward, weathered tempera paint on wall, flat perspective, ochre and pale gold colors --aspect 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 3: Francis the Fighter

Young Francis with pointed beard on horseback in chainmail looking up at golden cross in sky, medieval fresco style, weathered wall texture, flat Byzantine perspective, muted browns and gold --aspect 2:3 --v 7

Chapter 4: Francis the Builder

Francis carrying stones to rebuild small church, crucifix visible in ruined wall, other townspeople helping, medieval fresco style, weathered texture, flat perspective, earth tones --aspect 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 5: Le Jongleur de Dieu

Francis with pointed beard dancing joyfully outside cave, simple brown habit, birds watching, medieval manuscript marginalia style, flat decorative style, bright but faded colors --aspect 2:3 --v 7

Chapter 6: The Little Poor Man

Francis in brown habit preaching to many small birds on ground and trees, Italian countryside, medieval fresco style, flat perspective, weathered wall texture, warm earth tones --aspect 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 7: The Three Orders

Three groups around small chapel: brown-robed friars, grey-robed nuns, ordinary dressed townspeople, Francis and woman praying at center, medieval fresco, flat hierarchical composition, weathered texture --aspect 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 8: The Mirror of Christ

Francis kneeling on mountain peak, six-winged angel in golden clouds above, light rays connecting them, medieval fresco style, Byzantine flat perspective, weathered purple and gold --aspect 2:3 --v 7

Chapter 9: Miracles and Death

Francis lying on ground, circle of brown-robed friars kneeling around him, white dove above, medieval fresco death scene style, weathered wall texture, muted browns and pale gold --aspect 3:2 --v 7

Chapter 10: The Testament of St. Francis

Large tree growing with Francis small at base, tree branches containing tiny scenes of churches, poor being fed, monks studying, medieval manuscript tree of life style, weathered colors, flat perspective --aspect 2:3 --v 7

These prompts maintain consistent style elements:

    Weathered fresco/wall texture
    Flat Byzantine/medieval perspective
    Francis always with pointed beard
    Muted, aged colors
    Simple, symbolic rather than realistic

This should give you a cohesive set of illustrations that look like they belong together in the same medieval manuscript or church.

Ok 10 Images in folder  10 chapters how do i link without destorting

To link your 10 images to the 10 chapters without distortion, here are the best approaches:
For Print (Physical Book)

In Word/Google Docs:

    Insert → Image for each chapter
    Right-click image → "Wrap Text" → "In line with text"
    Right-click → "Size and Position"
    Check "Lock aspect ratio" ✓
    Set width to match your page width (e.g., 9 inches for landscape, 6 inches for portrait)
    Height will auto-adjust to prevent distortion

For Digital (eBook/PDF)

Best practices:

    Save all images at 300 DPI for print quality
    Name them clearly: Ch01_Problem.jpg, Ch02_World.jpg, etc.
    Create a master page size (9x6 inches)
    Place each image to fill the page width, letting height adjust proportionally

Quick InDesign/Publisher Method

    Create 9x6 inch pages
    Place image (Ctrl/Cmd + D)
    Hold Shift while resizing (maintains proportions)
    Fit to page width, center vertically

For Web/Digital Viewing
html

<img src="Ch01_Problem.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

This maintains aspect ratio automatically.

Critical tip: Never stretch images to fill both width AND height simultaneously - always let one dimension auto-adjust to prevent distortion.

Which format are you creating - print book, PDF, or eBook?

I want pre chapter image full page

For full-page pre-chapter images without distortion, here's the best approach:
Full Page Image Setup
For 9x6 inch pages:

Portrait orientation chapters (2:3 ratio):

    Your image fills 6" wide x 9" tall - perfect fit, no distortion

Landscape orientation chapters (3:2 ratio):

    Your image is 9" wide x 6" tall - perfect fit, no distortion

The Problem:

If your book pages are 9x6 (landscape) but some images are portrait (2:3), or vice versa, you have three options:
Option 1: Letterboxing (Recommended)

    Center the image on the page
    Leave white/colored bars on top/bottom or sides
    No distortion, artistic presentation

Option 2: Crop to Fit

    Lose some of the image edges
    Fills the entire page
    May cut off important details

Option 3: Alternate Page Orientation

    Landscape chapters on landscape pages
    Portrait chapters on portrait pages
    Reader rotates book for some chapters

Practical Implementation:

In Word/InDesign:

    Set page size to 9x6
    Insert image
    Center on page
    For "letterbox" style, leave margins
    For "full bleed," extend image past page edges (for printing)

Which of your 10 images are portrait vs landscape? I can help you plan the best layout strategy based on what you actually have.

If the image is enterd the way the image wants to go wheather potrate or landscape will that do

Yes, exactly! That's the simplest and best solution. Let each image display in its natural orientation:
Mixed Orientation Layout

Portrait images (2:3):

    Display vertically on the page
    Reader holds book normally

Landscape images (3:2):

    Display horizontally on the page
    Reader rotates book 90 degrees to view

This is actually very common in art books and illustrated manuscripts. Many medieval manuscripts did exactly this - mixing orientations based on what best suited each illustration.
Benefits:

    No distortion at all
    Each image shown at maximum size
    Creates visual variety in the book
    Very traditional for illuminated religious texts

In Practice:

Just insert each image at full size in its natural orientation. Most publishing software will automatically handle this when you insert the images.
Your 10 Chapters:

Based on our prompts, you'd have:

    Landscape: Chapters 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
    Portrait: Chapters 3, 5, 8, 10

This creates a nice rhythm throughout the book, and readers will naturally turn the book as needed. This is the most respectful way to present the artwork without any distortion or cropping.

I want each Chapter to start on a right hand page. when text in paragraph is finnisht should i put page break or section

For a book where each chapter starts on a right-hand page, use section breaks, not simple page breaks.
Section Break Setup (Word/Google Docs)

In Microsoft Word:

    At the end of each chapter's text: Insert → Break → Section Break (Odd Page)
    This automatically forces the next chapter to start on the right (odd-numbered) page
    If needed, Word adds a blank left page

In Google Docs:

    Insert → Break → Section break (next page)
    Then manually add a blank page if needed to ensure right-side start

Your Chapter Structure:

[Left: Blank or Title Page] | [Right: Chapter 1 Image]
[Left: Chapter 1 Text...] | [Right: Text continues...]
[Left: Text continues...] | [Right: Text ends]
[SECTION BREAK]
[Left: Blank if needed] | [Right: Chapter 2 Image]
[Left: Chapter 2 Text...] | [Right: Text continues...]

Important Settings:

    Number odd pages on the right (1, 3, 5...)
    Number even pages on the left (2, 4, 6...)
    In Word: Layout → Page Setup → "Different Odd & Even Pages"

Section breaks also allow you to:

    Reset page numbering if needed
    Change headers/footers per chapter
    Maintain proper book formatting

This is standard book publishing format - chapters always starting on the right (recto) page.

Overleaf

For Overleaf (LaTeX), here's how to set up your St. Francis book with right-hand chapter starts:
LaTeX/Overleaf Setup for Right-Hand Chapters
Document Class:
latex

\documentclass[twoside,openright]{book}

    twoside = different odd/even pages
    openright = chapters start on right (odd) pages

Full Chapter Structure:
latex

\documentclass[twoside,openright,11pt]{book}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[paperwidth=9in,paperheight=6in,margin=1in]{geometry}

\begin{document}

% Chapter 1
\chapter*{} % Invisible chapter heading
\thispagestyle{empty} % No page number on image page
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Ch01_Problem.jpg}
\clearpage

\chapter{The Problem of St. Francis}
Your chapter text here...

% Chapter 2
\chapter*{}
\thispagestyle{empty}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Ch02_World.jpg}
\clearpage

\chapter{The World St. Francis Found}
Your chapter text here...

% And so on...

\end{document}

For Mixed Orientations:
latex

\usepackage{rotating}

% For portrait images on landscape pages:
\begin{sidewaysfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Ch03_Fighter.jpg}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

Key Commands:

    \cleardoublepage - forces next content to odd page
    \clearpage - ends current page
    LaTeX automatically adds blank pages when using openright

This setup ensures each chapter image appears on right-hand page, followed by chapter text.

Can you tel me where the line in the code where that code snipt gose

Here's exactly where each code snippet goes in your Overleaf document:

% Continue this pattern for all 10 chapters...

\end{document}  % END OF DOCUMENT

The \usepackage commands go in the preamble (before \begin{document}). Each chapter follows the same pattern inside the document body.

Looking at your Overleaf template, here's exactly where to insert the chapter images:
Location in Your Code:

The code for inserting full-page images before each chapter starts at line 415 in your template where it says:
latex

% ==============================================================================
% CHAPTER 1
% ==============================================================================
% Add full-page image before chapter
\fullpageimage{images/u3859513984_subject_medieval_Irish_manuscript_illumination_styl_34921929-8a19-43e9-9d61-d12a50c59826.png}

\chapter{The Problem of St. Francis}

Your Template Already Has Everything Set Up!

The good news is your template already includes:

    The \fullpageimage command (defined at line 197)
    The \fullpageimagelandscape command (defined at line 209) for rotated landscape images
    Examples already in place for the first few chapters

To Add Your Images:

    Upload your 10 images to Overleaf (create an "images" folder if not already there)
    Name them clearly: Ch01_Problem.jpg, Ch02_World.jpg, etc.
    Replace the placeholder filenames in the template with your actual filenames

For example, change:
latex

\fullpageimage{images/u3859513984_subject_medieval_Irish_manuscript_illumination_styl_34921929-8a19-43e9-9d61-d12a50c59826.png}

To:
latex

\fullpageimage{images/Ch01_Problem.jpg}

For Mixed Orientations:

    Portrait images: Use \fullpageimage{images/filename.jpg}
    Landscape images: Use \fullpageimagelandscape{images/filename.jpg}

The landscape command (line 209) automatically rotates the image 90 degrees so readers turn the book to view it.

Your template is perfectly set up for this - you just need to replace the placeholder image filenames with your actual files!

\fullpageimagelandscape{images/Chapter 1- The Problem of St. Francis.png}  The Image is onely half its with the hight is ok

The issue with your landscape image being only half-width is likely due to how the \fullpageimagelandscape command handles the image dimensions. Let's fix this.
The Problem:

The current command (line 209) uses:
latex

\includegraphics[width=\paperheight,height=\paperwidth,keepaspectratio=false]

But when rotated 90 degrees, this might not fill the page correctly if your image has different proportions.
Solution - Replace the command at line 209:
latex

\newcommand{\fullpageimagelandscape}[1]{%
    \clearpage
    \thispagestyle{empty}
    \AddToShipoutPictureBG*{%
        \AtPageCenter{%
            \makebox[0pt][c]{%
                \rotatebox{90}{%
                    \includegraphics[height=\paperwidth]{#1}%
                }%
            }%
        }%
    }
    \null
    \clearpage
}

This simplified version:

    Rotates the image 90 degrees
    Sets only the height (which becomes width after rotation)
    Lets the width scale proportionally

Alternative if that doesn't work:

Try this version instead:
latex

\newcommand{\fullpageimagelandscape}[1]{%
    \clearpage
    \thispagestyle{empty}
    \vspace*{\fill}
    \begin{center}
        \rotatebox{90}{\includegraphics[width=\paperheight]{#1}}
    \end{center}
    \vspace*{\fill}
    \clearpage
}

Or for a quick test:

Just use the regular \fullpageimage command for all images (both portrait and landscape). Readers will naturally rotate the book when they see a landscape image displayed vertically.

Try the first solution and let me know if the landscape image now fills the page width properly when rotated.

Looking at your document, I see you have duplicate definitions of \fullpageimagelandscape (lines 207 and 235). Also, the version at line 235 still has the problematic keepaspectratio=false with both width and height specified.

Here's the fix:
1. Delete the duplicate at line 207

Remove lines 207-218 entirely (the first \fullpageimagelandscape definition).
2. Replace the second definition (currently at line 235)

Replace lines 235-247 with this improved version:
latex

% Full page image (landscape orientation - rotated 90 degrees)
\newcommand{\fullpageimagelandscape}[1]{%
    \clearpage
    \thispagestyle{empty}
    \AddToShipoutPictureBG*{%
        \AtPageCenter{%
            \makebox[0pt][c]{%
                \rotatebox{90}{%
                    \includegraphics[width=\paperheight]{#1}%
                }%
            }%
        }%
    }
    \null
    \clearpage
}

Why this works:

    The image is rotated 90 degrees
    After rotation, we only specify width=\paperheight (which becomes the width of the rotated image)
    The height scales proportionally to maintain aspect ratio
    The image is centered on the page

Alternative if you want to ensure full coverage:

If you want the landscape image to completely fill the page (potentially cropping), use:
latex

\newcommand{\fullpageimagelandscape}[1]{%
    \clearpage
    \thispagestyle{empty}
    \AddToShipoutPictureBG*{%
        \AtPageCenter{%
            \makebox[0pt][c]{%
                \rotatebox{90}{%
                    \includegraphics[width=\paperheight,height=\paperwidth,keepaspectratio=false]{#1}%
                }%
            }%
        }%
    }
    \null
    \clearpage
}

Try the first solution - it should fix the half-width issue while maintaining your image's proportions.

can you do that

I can't directly edit your Overleaf document, but I can give you the exact code to copy and paste. Here's what you need to do:
Step 1: Delete lines 207-218

These lines contain the first (problematic) definition of \fullpageimagelandscape.
Step 2: Replace lines 235-247

Replace your current second definition with this code:
latex

% Full page image (landscape orientation - rotated 90 degrees)
\newcommand{\fullpageimagelandscape}[1]{%
    \clearpage
    \thispagestyle{empty}
    \AddToShipoutPictureBG*{%
        \AtPageCenter{%
            \makebox[0pt][c]{%
                \rotatebox{90}{%
                    \includegraphics[width=\paperheight]{#1}%
                }%
            }%
        }%
    }
    \null
    \clearpage
}

To make these changes in Overleaf:

    Click in your document at line 207
    Select and delete lines 207-218 (the first \newcommand{\fullpageimagelandscape}...)
    Find the second definition (now around line 223-235)
    Select that entire command
    Replace it with the code above
    Recompile your document

This should fix the half-width issue with your landscape images. The key change is using only width=\paperheight instead of specifying both dimensions with keepaspectratio=false.

I can see there are several issues in your document that are causing compilation errors:
Main Problems:

    Line 5-8: You have stray lines of code that don't belong in the preamble:

latex

%  \begin{figure}[p]
    \thispagestyle{empty}
    \clearpage
%  \end{figure}

Delete these lines entirely.

    Line 207: You have an incomplete/broken \fullpageimagelandscape command that's missing its closing brace.
    Line 239-247: Another incomplete command block with stray code.
    Line 252-260: Yet another incomplete block.
    Line 367-370: The \maketitlepage command is being called twice with broken syntax.

Here's what to fix:
1. Delete lines 5-8 completely
2. Replace the broken \fullpageimagelandscape command (around line 207-220) with this clean version:
latex

3. Delete the duplicate/broken versions (lines 239-260)
4. Fix the title page section (around line 367-370). Replace with:
latex

% Title page
\maketitlepage
    {St. Francis of Assisi}
    {}
    {G.K. Chesterton}
    {LuLu Press}

After making these changes, your document should compile properly. The key issue is that you have multiple incomplete and duplicate command definitions that are confusing the LaTeX compiler.

can you make corrections

I'll create a corrected version of your LaTeX document. Here's the cleaned-up code with all the issues fixed:

(The rest of your chapter content remains the same - I've only fixed the preamble and front matter)

The main corrections I made:

    Removed all the stray code fragments
    Fixed the \fullpageimagelandscape command definition
    Removed duplicate and incomplete command definitions
    Fixed the title page call
    Cleaned up the overall structure

This should now compile without errors in Overleaf using LuaLaTeX.
